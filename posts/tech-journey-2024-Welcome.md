Are the heroes all good? Are the villains all bad?

While the protagonists and antagonists do tend to follow the archetype of good guys and bad guys, it would be ignorant to reduce them to just "good" or "bad." Many of the characters are very multidimensional, whether through unconventional backgrounds such as theivery and smuggling or starting off one side and eventually switching through major events or simply a change of heart. There are some exclusions to this generalization, as with any statement. Emperor Palpatine has not been shown to have any significant changes, nor has he shown any remorse. He is the embodiment of evil in the star wars franchise, simply a merciless, power hungry, and arrogant decrepit husk of a man.
